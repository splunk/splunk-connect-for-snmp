## High Availability Considerations

The SNMP protocol uses UDP as the transport protocol and is subject to network reliability, as
a constraint. Network architecture should be considered when designing for high availability.

* When using a single node collector ensure automatic recovery from virtual infrastructure i.e. VMware, Openstack, etc.
* When using a multi-node cluster ensure nodes are not located such that a simple majority of nodes can
be lost for example consider row, rack, network, power, storage
* When determining the placement of clusters the closest location by the number of network hops should be utilized.
* For "data center" applications collection should be local to the data center.
* Consider IP Anycast
