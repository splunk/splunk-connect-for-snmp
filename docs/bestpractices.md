# Debug Splunk Connect for SNMP

## Pieces of Advice

### Check when SNMP WALK was executed last time for the device
1. [Configure Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes](gettingstarted/sck-installation.md)
2. Go to your Splunk and execute search: `index="em_logs"   "Sending due task" "sc4snmp;<IP_ADDRESS>;walk"` 
and replace <IP_ADDRESS> with the pertinent IP Address. 

### Installing Splunk Connect for SNMP on Linux RedHat 
Installation of RedHat may be blocking ports required by microk8s. Installing microk8s on RedHat 
requires checking to see if the firewall is not blocking any of [required microk8s ports](https://microk8s.io/docs/ports). 

## Issues

### "Empty SNMP response message" problem
In case you see the following line in the worker's logs:

```log
[2022-01-04 11:44:22,553: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-1] Task splunk_connect_for_snmp.snmp.tasks.walk[8e62fc62-569c-473f-a765-ff92577774e5] retry: Retry in 3489s: SnmpActionError('An error of SNMP isWalk=True for a host 192.168.10.20 occurred: Empty SNMP response message')
```
that causes infinite retry of walk operation, add `worker.ignoreEmptyVarbinds` parameter to `values.yaml` and set it to true.

An example configuration for a worker in `values.yaml` is:

```yaml
worker:
  ignoreEmptyVarbinds: true
```

### "OID not increasing" problem
In case you see the following line in worker's logs:

```log
[2022-01-04 11:44:22,553: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-1] Task splunk_connect_for_snmp.snmp.tasks.walk[8e62fc62-569c-473f-a765-ff92577774e5] retry: Retry in 3489s: SnmpActionError('An error of SNMP isWalk=True for a host 192.168.10.20 occurred: OID not increasing')
```
that causes infinite retry of walk operation, add `worker.ignoreNotIncreasingOid` array to `values.yaml` and fill with the addresses of hosts where the problem appears.

An example configuration for a worker in `values.yaml` is:

```yaml
worker:
  ignoreNotIncreasingOid:
    - "127.0.0.1:164"
    - "127.0.0.6"
```

If you put only IP address (ex. `127.0.0.1`), then errors will be ignored for all of its devices (like `127.0.0.1:161`, 
`127.0.0.1:163`...). If you put IP address and host structured as `{host}:{port}`, that means the error will be ignored only for this device.

### Walking a device takes too much time

Enable small walk functionality with the following instruction: [Configure small walk profile](../configuration/configuring-profiles/#walk-profile). 

### An error of SNMP isWalk=True blocks traffic on SC4SNMP instance

If you see many `An error of SNMP isWalk=True` errors in logs, that means that there is a connection problem with the hosts you're polling from.
Walk will try to retry multiple times, which will eventually cause a worker to be blocked for the retries time. In this case, you might want to limit
the maximum retries time. You can do this by setting the variable `worker.walkRetryMaxInterval`, for example:

```yaml
worker:
  walkRetryMaxInterval: 60
```

With the configuration from the above, 'walk' will retry exponentially from 30 seconds until it reaches 60 seconds. Default value for `worker.walkRetryMaxInterval` is 180.

### SNMP Rollover
The Rollover problem is due to the integer value stored (especially when the value is 32-bit) being finite. 
When it reaches its maximum, it gets rolled down to 0 again. This causes a strange drop in Analytics data.
The most common case of this issue is interface speed on high speed ports. As a solution to this problem, SNMPv2 SMI defined a new object type, counter64, for 64-bit counters ([read more about it](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/26007-faq-snmpcounter.html)).
Not all the devices support it, but if they do, poll the counter64 type OID instead of the counter32 one. 
For example, use `ifHCInOctets` instead of `ifInOctets`.

If 64-bit counter are not supported on your device, you can write your own Splunk queries that calculate the shift based on
maximum integer value + current state. The same works for values big enough that they're not fitting a 64-bit value.
An example for a SPLUNK query like that (interface counter), would be:

```
| streamstats current=f last(ifInOctets) as p_ifInOctets last(ifOutOctets) as p_ifOutOctets by ifAlias             
| eval in_delta=(ifInOctets - p_ifInOctets)
| eval out_delta=(ifOutOctets - p_ifOutOctets)
| eval max=pow(2,64)
| eval out = if(out_delta<0,((max+out_delta)*8/(5*60*1000*1000*1000)),(out_delta)*8/(5*60*1000*1000*1000))
| timechart span=5m avg(in) AS in, avg(out) AS out by ifAlias
```
### "Field is immutable" error during helm upgrade

```
microk8s helm3 upgrade --install snmp -f values.yaml splunk-connect-for-snmp/charts/splunk-connect-for-snmp/ --namespace=sc4snmp --create-namespace
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "snmp-splunk-connect-for-snmp-inventory" with kind Job: Job.batch "snmp-splunk-connect-for-snmp-inventory" is invalid: (...) : field is immutable
```

The immutable error is due to the limitation placed on an inventory job. As the SC4SNMP requires several checks before applying updates, it is designed to allow changes in the inventory task after 5 minutes. 

The status of the inventory can be checked with a command:
```
microk8s kubectl -n sc4snmp get pods | grep inventory
```
If the command is not empty, wait and execute it again after the inventory job finishes (no longer visible in the output).

If the changes are required to be applied immedietly, the previous inventory job can be deleted with the command:
```
microk8s kubectl delete job/snmp-splunk-connect-for-snmp-inventory -n sc4snmp
```
The upgrade command can be executed again.
