# Deployment using docker compose

SC4SNMP now offers beta support for docker-compose providing an alternative method for project deployment. 
While this is in beta, we encourage users to explore it. Although we've conducted extensive testing, occasional issues may arise.
Your feedback during this phase is crucial in refining and optimizing and can be shared using [issues](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-snmp/issues).
To get started, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-snmp/tree/fix/docker-compose/docs/dockercompose) 
and `fix/docker-compose` branch for  instructions on setting up and running SC4SNMP using docker-compose.
Your involvement in testing docker-compose support is pivotal, and we look forward to hearing about your experiences.
