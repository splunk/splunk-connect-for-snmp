# Lightweight SC4SNMP installation

SC4SNMP can be successfully installed in small environments with 2 CPUs and 4 GB of memory.
One important thing to remember is that Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes cannot be installed in such a small
environment along with SC4SNMP. The other difference from normal installation is that the `resources` limits must be set for Kubernetes
pods. See the example of `values.yaml` with the appropriate resources below:

```yaml
splunk:
  enabled: true
  protocol: https
  host: ###SPLUNK_HOST###
  token: ###SPLUNK_TOKEN###
  insecureSSL: "false"
  port: "###SPLUNK_PORT###"

```

The rest of the installation is the same as in [online](gettingstarted/sc4snmp-installation.md), or the
[offline](offlineinstallation/offline-sc4snmp.md) installation.

Keep in mind that a lightweight instance of SC4SNMP won't be able to poll from many devices and may experience delays 
if there is frequent polling.
