# SNMPv3 secrets

## Migration steps
Managing SNMPv3 secrets previously required updating docker compose files using the manage_secrets.py script.
From SC4SNMP 1.15.0, this process has been simplified and can manage all SNMPv3 secrets using a single secrets.json file.

#### 1. For setups not yet migrated to latest version
First, delete all existing secrets from docker-compose.yaml using manage_secrets.py with the following flags:

| Flag                | Description                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------| 
| `--secret_name`     | Secret name                                          |
| `--path_to_compose` | Absolute path to directory with docker compose files |
| `--delete`          | Set this flag to true to delete the secret           |

This will delete the secret with a given name from all docker compose files. If this secret hasn't been deleted from `.env` 
file, it will be removed from there. 

#### 2. For setups already migrated to latest version
Manually delete the secrets from the docker-compose.yaml file under the worker-poller and worker-trap services.
Remove the corresponding entries from the .env file.


After deleting the secrets, follow the below mention steps to configure secrets.

## Prerequisites

A folder must be created to store the secrets file.
Inside this folder, create a secrets.json file that contains all SNMPv3 secrets.

#### Example of secrets.json
```json
{
  "secret_name": {
    "username": "user1",
    "privprotocol": "AES",
    "privkey": "privkey1",
    "authprotocol": "SHA",
    "authkey": "authkey1",
    "contextengineid": "engineid1"
  },
}
```

> **_NOTE:_** The name of json file should be secrets.json and secrets should have non-empty fields (except contextengineid).

## Configuration
In the .env file, set the path to the local folder containing the secrets.json:
```
SECRET_FOLDER_PATH=/absolute/path/to/secrets/folder
```

Secrets usage for worker-poller and worker-trap can be controlled by flags in .env:
```
ENABLE_WORKER_TRAPS_SECRETS=true
ENABLE_WORKER_POLLER_SECRETS=true
```


## Creating a new secret

To create a new secret, 
create secrets.json file inside folder (at SECRET_FOLDER_PATH), add entry for the new secrets with all the details.

Inside `docker_compose` directory run:

```shell
<!-- sudo docker compose up -d -->
```

## Updating existing secret

To update any secret, 
update the required fields (e.g., keys, protocols, username) for any existing secret inside secrets.json file.

Inside `docker_compose` directory run:
```shell
<!-- docker-compose up -d --force-recreate <service_name> -->
```

## Deleting a secret

To delete a secret,
delete its entry from the secrets.json file.

Inside `docker_compose` directory run:
```shell
<!-- docker-compose up -d --force-recreate <service_name> -->
```
