Splunk Connect for SNMP (SC4SNMP) is a solution that allows the customer to "get" data from 
network devices and appliances where a more feature complete solution such as the 
Splunk Universal Forwarder is not available.

Architecture
===================================================

SC4SNMP is deployed using a Kubernetes distribution typically MicroK8s, deseigned to be 
a low touch experience for integration with sensitive edge network devices it will typically be
deployed in the same network management zone as the monitored devices and seperated from Splunk by
an existing firewall.
