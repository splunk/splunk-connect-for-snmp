Default walk no longer calls full oid tree, instead it is collecting only 'SNMPv2-MIB'.
If you want to call full oid for the devices, you have to set enableFullWalk flag to true.
If the discovery feature is enabled, the time required may increase depending on the number of devices in the specified subnet.
