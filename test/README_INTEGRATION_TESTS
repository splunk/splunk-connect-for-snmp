How to run an integration test?

Right now we support only NOVA.
- login into NOVA: https://splunkit.io/ec2
- create an EC2 instance with the following specs:
  - t3.medium
  - 50 GB (this is the default value)
  - ubuntu 18
- create a splunk instance with all the default settings
- git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-snmp.git
- cd splunk-connect-for-snmp
- git checkout feature/integration-tests-poller
- cd test
- ./deploy_and_test.sh
  - you'll be asked to provide your Splunk's instance IP (you can get it from NOVA)
  - you'll be asked to provide your Splunk's intance password (again, you can get it from NOVA)
  - the test will install/deploy everything, will run all the integration tests and it will prompt
    you this message:
    "Press ENTER to undeploy everything"
    Once you press any key, everything will be undeployed (kubernets, secrets, snmp simulator, ...).
    In this way you can check your Splunk instance/Kubernetes' containers in order to check
    that everything is fine.
