Right now we support only NOVA.
- login into NOVA: https://splunkit.io/ec2
- create an EC2 instance with the following specs:
  - m5.xlarge
  - 50 GB (this is the default value)
  - Ubuntu 20


- git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-snmp.git
- cd splunk-connect-for-snmp
- git checkout <target_branch>
- cd integration_tests
- sudo ./install_microk8s.sh
- su <user_name>
- cd ~/splunk-connect-for-snmp/integration_tests
- ./automatic_setup.sh

Run with terraform and ansible. Use local_run.sh script. It has some prerequisites - AWS env variables and
ansible, terraform commands. It will return error and information if you are missing something. You should
define env variables in set_env.sh script. It is sourced in local_run.sh. To execute:
- ./local_run.sh
